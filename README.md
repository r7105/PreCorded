# PreCorded
Discord Bot Code Generator for Python, Node.js, Java, Go and other Lanugages, with Local Hosting Features
# Goal
Our Goal is to Reduce the need to pay for hosting and increase the library of bots available on discord that actually have purpose
# Our Methods of doing so?
Allowing users to use familiar UI's (Seen in BotGhost, BotWiz and Inventor.gg (some examples)) while also being able to take that code and use it themselves for no extra charge.
# When Will be the planned release date?
Hopefully Soon, we want to make lives easier by reducing the need to learn how the discord api fully works, we do it all for you while you can test run, copy, and edit the code.
